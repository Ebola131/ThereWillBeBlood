<p>A public repository for all changes to my Hardcore Modpack project.  This modpack focuses on the world around you its inhabitants; namely how much they loathe your existance and want you gone.  Everything in this pack is geared towards giving you a bad time.  You will fight to survive against not only difficult mobs in a similar fashion to the popular "Blood n' Bones" modpack by Eyamaz, but also against the enviroment itself.  You'll need to stay hydrated, regulate your body temperature, and watch out for the occasional pockets of various gases found under the earth.  The deeper you mine, the harder time you'll have breathing, and will need to find cleaner air in order to not suffocate.  Even keeping yourself full might be an issue; as you'll need to eat a varied and balanced diet in order to stay healthy.  You might be thinking, "this sounds insane!" and in a way, you'd be right; as certain mobs, especially those found in The Nether, will cause you to lose a bit of your sanity.</p>

<p>If you think you're up for the challenge, give this pack a try; but be warned, <em>there will be blood</em>.</p>

<p>I love getting outside contributions, however doing so can be a little complex for some.</p>

<p>First a note: If you are going to contribute, please make your contributions to the <strong><em>master</em></strong> branch.</p>

<p>Also, if you are just planning on making a one-line change, or anything that just alters one file, you can simply find the file and press "edit", and github will do the rest.</p>

<p>To make any larger contributions, it is recommended to have <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">Github for Windows/Mac/Linux</a> installed (use the orange button for the application, or the rest of the article for command line git).</p>

<p>To do so you will need to make what is called a "fork" of this repository. To do this press the "Fork" button on the top right of the page, and github will create your own copy of this repository. Once that has completed, use the github application to "clone" this repository, <a href="http://help.github.com">Github Help</a> can help you with this portion. Make the changes on your computer, then commit and push those back to your fork (again, refer to the github help documents).</p>

<p>Once your fork has all the changes you want, you need to create a "pull request" on the main repository. To do this, go to the pull request tab on the right, and hit "new pull request". At the top of that screen hit "compare across forks", then choose the second dropdown on the first line to be "master", the first dropdown on the second line to be <em>your</em> fork, and the final dropdown to be "master" again (This may require hitting "compare across forks" and "edit" quite a few times to get it right). If everything looks right, meaning you see all your commits on the screen, hit "Create pull request" and I will review it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Thank you for your help!</p>
